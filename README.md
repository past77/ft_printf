It's my first project on branch of algorithms and as for me, it is awful project.

It's impossible, but try to enjoy ;)

For faster start use this: "
gcc ft_printf.c  pt_digit.c pt_string.c lib_fn1.c lib_fn2.c lib_fn3.c perc_and_char.c \
 annonce_flags.c float_pt2.c  colors.c choose_type.c ft_write_pt1.c ft_write_pt2.c ft_write_pt3.c \
 write_press.c write_main_press.c ft_rapist.c fills.c ft_uns_digits.c rape_float.c lib_fn0.c  mina.c "
