[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     The [1mscript[0m utility makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is use-[m
     ful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive session as proof of an[m
     assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out later with lpr(1).[m
[m
     If the argument [4mfile[24m is given, [1mscript[0m saves all dialogue in [4mfile[24m.  If no file name is[m
     given, the typescript is saved in the file [4mtypescript[24m.[m
[m
     If the argument [4mcommand[24m is given, [1mscript[0m will run the specified command with an optional[m
     argument vector instead of an interactive shell.[m
[m
     The following options are available:[m

             The default interval is 30 seconds.[m
[m

[m
     Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1), create garbage in the typescript file.  The[m
     [1mscript[0m utility works best with commands that do not manipulate the screen.  The results[m
     are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal, not an addressable one.[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     The [1mscript[0m utility makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is use-[m
     ful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive session as proof of an[m
     assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out later with lpr(1).[m
[m
     If the argument [4mfile[24m is given, [1mscript[0m saves all dialogue in [4mfile[24m.  If no file name is[m
     given, the typescript is saved in the file [4mtypescript[24m.[m
[m
     If the argument [4mcommand[24m is given, [1mscript[0m will run the specified command with an optional[m
     argument vector instead of an interactive shell.[m
[m
     The following options are available:[m
[m
     [1m-a[0m      Append the output to [4mfile[24m or [4mtypescript[24m, retaining the prior contents.[m
[m
     [1m-d[0m      When playing back a session with the [1m-p[0m flag, do not sleep between records when[m
             playing back a timestamped session.[m
[m
     [1m-F[0m [4mpipe[24m[m
             Immediately flush output after each write.  This will allow a user to create a[m
             named pipe using mkfifo(1) and another user may watch the live session using a[m
             utility like cat(1).[m
[m
     [1m-k[0m      Log keys sent to the program as well as output.[m
[m
     [1m-p[0m      Play back a session recorded with the [1m-r[0m flag in real time.[m
[m
     [1m-q[0m      Run in quiet mode, omit the start, stop and command status messages.[m
[m
     [1m-r[0m      Record a session with input, output, and timestamping.[m
[m
     [1m-t[0m [4mtime[24m[m
             Specify the interval at which the script output file will be flushed to disk, in[m
             seconds.  A value of 0 causes [1mscript[0m to flush after every character I/O event.[m
             The default interval is 30 seconds.[m
[m
     The script ends when the forked shell (or command) exits (a [4mcontrol-D[24m to exit the Bourne[m
     shell (sh(1)), and [4mexit[24m, [4mlogout[24m or [4mcontrol-D[24m (if [4mignoreeof[24m is not set) for the C-shell,[m

     Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1), create garbage in the typescript file.  The[m

     are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal, not an addressable one.[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     The [1mscript[0m utility makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is use-[m

     If the argument [4mfile[24m is given, [1mscript[0m saves all dialogue in [4mfile[24m.  If no file name is[m
